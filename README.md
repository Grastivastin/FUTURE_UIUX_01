# UI/UX Task 1 – Restaurant Menu & Ordering Interface

## 🛠️ Project Overview
As part of Task 1 in the Future Interns UI/UX internship, I designed a modern digital menu and ordering interface for a restaurant. The design allows users to browse food by category, view images and prices, add items to a cart, and complete orders for Dine-In or Takeaway.

This design demonstrates UI layout, user flow planning, and clean visual presentation — inspired by apps like Swiggy and Zomato. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
